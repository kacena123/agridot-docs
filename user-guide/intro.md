#### Field Management as NFT Collections 🚜:
Farmers can create their fields as NFT Collections, which can be designated as either public or private:

- Public Fields: These fields are publicly visible on the blockchain and indexable by indexers, enabling verifiable crop origin proofs. By ensuring transparency, these proofs can enhance trust between farmers and their business partners.
- Private Fields: Metadata for private fields is encrypted, ensuring privacy. Only the field owner can access the data through AgriDot using the password they created. Thus, no one except them has access to their Data.
#### Crop Management as NFTs 🌾:
Farmers can attach crops to their fields as NFTs, enabling transparent documentation of crop history. Crops are the same format as fields. If fields are private, crops are created as private as well.

#### Weather Monitoring ☀️:
Farmers can access hourly and long-term weather forecasts for their fields, aiding in better decision-making.

#### Pest Tracking 🧫:
Farmers can report pest occurrences in their fields and share this data with nearby farmers. The pest reports, minted as NFTs, foster community collaboration by helping others anticipate and mitigate pest risks. The platform maintains privacy for private field owners by displaying pest proximity rather than exact locations.

#### Knowledge Sharing 📕:
AgriDot allows farmers to create and share agricultural guides, including best practices for crop cultivation. These guides are also minted as NFTs, with farmers rewarded through likes counting as voluntary donations made by other farmers. The best guides are then displayed on top.

#### Moderation and Community Support 🧑‍🌾:
To maintain content quality, the AgriDot team moderates pest reports and guides. Farmers can report malicious content, which can be reviewed and removed by removing the associated NFT metadata.

#### Transparent Crop Origin Proofs 🕵️‍♀️:
Using public field NFTs, farmers can create crop origin proofs as NFTs, reinforcing trust and transparency in their supply chains.

### How AgriDot Outshines Traditional Agriculture Apps 💡
Unlike traditional Web2 agricultural apps, AgriDot offers:

- Decentralized Data: No centralized databases that store private user data — ensuring transparency and privacy.
- Fully open source code: For everything. No hidden catches; all code is publicly available for exploration
- Immutable Records: Blockchain ensures that all data, from pest reports to crop origins, is verifiable and unalterable.
