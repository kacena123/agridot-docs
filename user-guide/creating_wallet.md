# Guide to Create a Wallet for Interaction with Your First Web3 Application üñºÔ∏è

A wallet is a tool that allows you to interact with Blockchain and sign transactions.  

There are multiple wallet providers for different blockchains. The blockchain that AgriDot is integrated with is Kusama. Kusama is a multichain network with great cross-chain capabilities, fast transaction processing times, and very cheap transaction fees. Creating an NFT asset on Kusama costs less than 5 cents!

## What is a Blockchain Wallet? üè¶

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage your cryptocurrency, including NFTs. It enables you to send, receive, and monitor your cryptocurrency balances. Unlike a traditional wallet that holds physical money, a blockchain wallet holds cryptographic information that allows you to access your digital assets on the blockchain.

### Key Features of a Blockchain Wallet üîë

1.  **Secure Access**: Wallets use cryptographic keys to secure your digital assets. You have a public key (like an account number) and a private key (like a password) that you must keep secret.

2.  **Ownership**: You control your assets without needing a third party, which is fundamental to decentralized finance.

3.  **Transaction Capability**: Wallets allow you to send and receive digital assets by signing transactions.

4.  **Compatibility**: Wallets can interact with different blockchains, supporting various cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

### Step 3: Add Kusama Funds üí∞
To interact with Blockchain you will need some funds. You can purchase Kusama (KSM) asset on any well known exchange. For example Binance or Bybit.

1.  **Receive Kusama**: Click on "Receive" to find your Kusama address. You can share this address to receive Kusama tokens.

2.  **Transfer Funds**: Transfer some Kusama tokens to your wallet to cover transaction fees when creating or receiving NFTs.

3.  **Transfer your funds to Kusama Asset Hub** (If the exchange doesn't support it): You can use [following link](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/) to launch cross-chain playground.

4. **Connect your wallet to the cross-chain playground and fill out the message** according to the screenshot below. Make sure to format your message correctly.

**‚ùìUnsure where to find the address?** Open your wallet and click on receive. Copy Kusama address format. It is the same on both Kusama and Kusama Asset Hub. You can also copy the address of the wallet you used during withdrawal from the exchange.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNOTICE:** Make sure to include a little less than your actual balance! There are fees that are consumed during cross-chain transfer. The message will not execute if the account hasn't got enough balance. For example, you own 2.5 KSM on the Relay chain. Transfer 2.45 KSM to Asset Hub Kusama.

**‚ö†Ô∏èNOTICE2:** When entering the amount, make sure to add 12 zeros. KSM token has 12 decimals. This means that if you want to transfer 2.45 Kusama, enter 2450000000000 into the amount input.

### Step 4: Interact with AgriDot üé®

1.  **Connect Your Wallet**: Go to the AgriDot application and enter mnemonic you were given when you were generating your wallet.

2.  **Explore and Create Fields, Crops, Guides, Donations and Pest reports**: Once connected, you can create new NFT assets.

## Safety Tips üõ°Ô∏è
  
-  **Backup Your Mnemonic**: Always keep a backup of your seed phrase in a secure location. Losing it means losing access to your wallet forever.

-  **Use Strong Passwords**: Ensure your wallet and email accounts are protected with strong, unique passwords.

-  **Be Cautious of Scams**: Be wary of phishing attempts. Only interact with trusted sites and never enter your seed phrase online.

By following these steps, you will have successfully created a Talisman wallet and will be ready to interact with your first NFT assets on Kusama and AgriDot. Enjoy exploring the exciting world of NFTs! üöÄ
