# Welcome! Thank you for helping us grow üßë‚Äçüåæ.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;"><span>The structure of &nbsp;</span><img width="60" alt="Agridot_logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c906eba6-8122-4f3b-83f5-8ecb04f326ef" style="vertical-align: middle;"/><span>&nbsp; is fairly simple.</span></div>

- [Agridot repository](https://github.com/kacena123/AgriDot) holds the code to the main client expo react native mobile application.
- [Agridot backend repository]() holds code to the functionality behind pest and guide creation as well as pest fetching and like counting mechanisms.

`NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:`
Nothing that is sent to the AgriDot backend is ever sent anywhere else and the application stores all the private data in the secure storage on the device itself. The communication between backend and application uses AES encryption for additional safety. Please, keep it this way when forking AgriDot repositories and only improve it if possible. It is important for us to maintain transparency towards the users.

Feel free to continue towards `Launching AgriDot section`.
